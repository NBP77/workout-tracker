# workout-tracker

A Workout tracker application built with MongoDB/Mongoose  

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a workout tracker that allows the user to add, continue and complete a workout
 
-Once a user has added and completed a workout they can keep track of their progress by going to the stats page to see their total duration and weight from the past 7 workouts
 
-This app has a functioning backend that is connected to MongoDB

-The database and collections were all created "dynamically" within JS using Mongoose

-Each route is built using Mongoose syntax.
